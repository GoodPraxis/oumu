# Uomo - Learn Japanese browsing websites

![Logo](extension_content/48-icon.png)

**Uomo** is a simple Chrome extension which replaces English words on websites
with Japanese equivelants. It uses vocabulary found in popular books like the
Genki series. The extension allows you to choose which Genki chapters you would
like to include.

Note that the extension only replaces single words, not phrases, and several
words have been ommitted to avoid confusion.
